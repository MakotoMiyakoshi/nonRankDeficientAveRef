% nonRankDeficientAveRef()--Performs re-reference to average potential that is defined as the
%                           average potential across all the channels INCLUDING the initial
%                           reference channel which is usually unipolar-in that case, the average
%                           is calculated as sum(EEG.data,1)/(EEG.nbchan+1). For the theory
%                           behind this calculation, see the following reference paper.
